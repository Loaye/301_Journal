Day 1

We learned about responsive web development in depth. Being able to manipulate a site using CSS rather than jQuery for some interaction was interesting. Also just pair programming with someone and having issues with communication. I continued on when my partner did not want to work with me. I was suppose to drive and he navigated. I am not the type to let someone else bring me down. We will fix it tomorrow after trying to reach out to them one more time.
